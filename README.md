# earthview

[Earth View](https://earthview.withgoogle.com/) is a great project, but I could not find a database of the pictures available for download.
My needs: (1) get all the pictures and (2) keep all related data (e.g. country, region, GPS coordinates).
While downloading all the pictures could be done with a brute-force like approach and try all possible id's (which in turn gives the download URL), one would not be able to keep all the data associated with the pictures.
Assuming that Earth View slideshow is not random (it's not) and will loop only once you've been through all the pictures, we can get what we want.

No need to use the Python script, all the data you need is in the CSV file.
